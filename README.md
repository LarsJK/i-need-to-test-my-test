# Route-test-problem

This app is made to illustrate a problem i have with acceptance testing an ember app.

I am testing that visting a url redirects correctly based on a models relatioship, and the rendering of the page.

These two tests seem to conflict. The A will fail one time i run the test, then the next time test B will fail and so on.
